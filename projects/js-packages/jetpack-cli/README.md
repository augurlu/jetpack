# Jetpack CLI

This adds the `jp` command to the monorepo. It is a development tool that runs commands in a Docker container so you don't have to deal with mismatched node/pnpm/PHP versions.

In large part this is a wrapper for the older `jetpack` command, but runs its commands in a Docker container.
