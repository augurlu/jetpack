When developing Unit Tests in PHP, follow these guidelines:

- Use PHPUnit with WordPress test framework
- Follow WordPress testing conventions
- Use WordPress fixtures and mocks
- Test WordPress hooks and filters

Regardless of WordPress conventions, the following naming conventions must be followed for PHPUnit tests:

- Test class names must end in "Test".
- Every test class must be contained in a file with a matching name. For example, test class `My_Unit_Test` must be in a file named `My_Unit_Test.php`.

Check [test_Manager_integration.php](mdc:jetpack/jetpack/jetpack/jetpack/projects/packages/connection/tests/php/test_Manager_integration.php) for an example.
